# ASan Mode

This is a not-so-work-in-progress example of how to use the Frida Stalker to
instrument a binary application with ASan instrumentation. It is incomplete,
buggy (it does not properly handle stack accesses, sometimes) and unmaintained.

However, it is probably a good reference if you are looking to do something
similar. If you find it useful, please make PR to point to your project.

This is released in the public domain, or the Unlicense, like the rest of Hotwax.
